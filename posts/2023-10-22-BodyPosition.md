# Body Position

"Body positioning is *the* most important thing to get right. Nailing it unlocks levels of control, grip and speed that just aren't consistently possible with poor form." - Ben Cathro

**Date** Thursday 26th of October

**Time** Meet at 5.30pm (sharp). Finish at approximately 6.30pm (fuzzy). We might keep riding until it gets dark, if we're having fun. (Don't forget lights if you are riding to or from the session). 

**Location** Grassy electricity easement on the Eastern side of [Calang Street, Orange](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pGaAZTJSiyJ5LtsXA).

## Good Body Position

Our body position theory content comes from Ben Cathro (World Cup downhill racer, team manager, media squid, and mountain bike coach). Try and watch this before the session.

## Equipment

**Wheel Good**

- cones
- stopwatch
- pen, paper, and clipboard (for writing times down)

**Participants**

- Bike
- Spares (usual self-rescue stuff; tube, pump, quick-link, trail-side tools)
- Helmet (full-face or open-face)
- Safety gear (gloves, knee-pads, elbow-pads). These are optional but highly recommended
- Water
- Lights (recommended even if you riding home in daylight, because it is a busy time for traffic, and the sun will be low).

## Practice

Body position can be hard to practice on its own ("Here, roll down a hill and practice moving from boss position to attack position."), but it comes into play whenever you are riding a mountain bike. Therefore, we're going to learn about body position in this session, and then keep it in mind and actively reflect on it in all of our sessions. We'll use our smartphone cameras to film each other and assess our own body position. 

To practice our body position in this session, we're going to do a flat cornering drill. We'll do a timed run first, then we'll focus on three components of body positioning in cornering. Then we'll do another timed run and see if our speed has improved. \([Here's a video](https://youtu.be/lJbOvl_Sup4?si=g6PTRNWoCcBY5zOO&t=137) of some people \(Finn Iles! Kasper Woolley!\) doing the drill).

1. Set up a slalom course with cones. Use 10 - 15 cones and create corners of varying tightness and separation.
2. One at a time, do a timed run of the course as fast as you. (You could organise yourselves into a 'production line' with one person riding the course, one person timing them, and one person filming them so that they can review their body position. Once the run is complete, the rider becomes the timer, the timer becomes the filmer, and the filmer joins the queue to ride the course).
3. Focus on having a centered body position.
    - Chest over bars; does something else work better for you? 
    - Do as many laps as you want/need to feel comfortable in a good position, and for the position to begin te be automatic, slowly increasing speed.
4. While maintaining a centered body position, focus on weighting your hands slightly.
    - How do *you* do that? What does it feel like?
    - Repeat until comfortable/automatic, increasing speed. 
5. Maintaining the techniques from the previous two steps, focus on weighting your outside hand.
    - You should feel your pectoral (chest) and tricep (back of your upper arm) muscles working.
    - Repeat until comfortable/automatic, increasing speed.
6. Practice combining all the techniques, and start building up speed. Focus on correct technique first, and increasing speed only after the technique is correct. 
7. Do a timed run.

## Debrief

Was you last run faster or slower than your first run?

Did you have any crashes? What caused your crash? What was your body position like before you crashed? Did it play a role in your crash?

## Next time ...

How to do a manual. Put flat pedals on your bike if you have any spare and come wearing flat shoes (flat shoes and pedals make it easier / less nerve-wracking to quickly dismount your bike while learning to manual).
